In different power tool, there will be different shape of HMI. I want to create a customized HMI page for user to interact. 

The size of HMI can be select by user, for example 100px * 200px
The HMI is combined by different elements, icon, button and status bar...
There will be an element library for user to choose, drag and put into the HMI main panel.
